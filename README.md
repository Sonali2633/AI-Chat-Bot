# AI-Chat-Bot
There are 4 things which we need on our system :
1.	Python version 3.7.0 or above (Python -3.10.0 Recommended): Ensure that you have Python installed on your system, preferably version 3.0.0 or later.
2.	OpenAI API Key: The code assumes that you have an OpenAI API key and sets it as an environment variable. Make sure you have obtained an API key from OpenAI and replace the placeholder 'sk- 
    thNIwomRIqP92JUHQhpOT3BlbkFJPjbfuWTWbOcmyyc45PjN' with your actual API key.
3.	LangChain library: The code uses the LangChain library, specifically the OpenAI class from it. Ensure that you have installed the LangChain library. You can install it using pip: 
4.	Jupyter Notebook:Ensure that you have Jupyter installed.

Steps to execute the project:
1.	Click on the "Code" button next to the "Add file" button.
2.	Select HTTPS and copy the URL.
3.	Open the folder where you want to run the project.
4.	Right-click and open the terminal.
5.	Type "git clone" and then paste the URL.
6.	Press enter.
7.	Open the "AI-Chat-Bot" folder.
8.	Open the terminal in this folder.
9.	Type the "jupyter notebook" command and press enter.
10.	Select and open the "langchain_bot.ipynb" Jupyter file.

To install LangChain run the command in your terminal:
â€¢	pip install langchain

To create an OpenAI API Key, you can follow these general instructions:

1.	Sign Up/Login to OpenAI: If you haven't already, go to the OpenAI website (https://openai.com/) and sign up for an account. If you already have an account, log in.
2.	Navigate to API: Once logged in, navigate to the API section of the OpenAI website. You can usually find this in the menu or through a direct link provided on the website.
3.	Create an API Key: In the API section, you should see an option to create an API key. Click on that option to generate a new API key.
4.	Generate Key: After choosing the access level, click on the button to generate the API key. The key should be generated instantly, and you'll typically see it displayed on the screen or receive it via email.
5.	Store the Key Securely: Once you have the API key, make sure to store it securely. Treat it like a password and avoid sharing it publicly. You'll need this API key to authenticate your requests when using the OpenAI API.
6.	Copy the API Key
7.	Use the API Key: In your code, you can set the OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable to your API key value, similar to what you've done in your code snippet. This allows your code to authenticate with the OpenAI API when making requests
8.	Make sure you have obtained an API key from OpenAI and replace the placeholder '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' with your actual API key

  To run the "langchain_bot.ipynb" Jupyter notebook file and interact with the chatbot, follow these steps:

1.	Open your Jupyter Notebook environment.
2.	Navigate to the directory where the "langchain_bot.ipynb" file is located.
3.	Click on the "langchain_bot.ipynb" file to open it within Jupyter Notebook.
4.	Execute the cells in the notebook by either clicking on the "Run" button or pressing "Shift + Enter" while the cell is selected.
5.	Once the notebook is running, you should see a prompt asking for input to the chatbot.
6.	Enter your text input to interact with the chatbot.
7.	When you want to exit the program execution, enter the text "exit" (without quotes) in lowercase.
8.	Follow any additional instructions or prompts provided within the notebook.
9.	Close the notebook or shut down the Jupyter environment when you're finished.
